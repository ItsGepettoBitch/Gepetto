## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**GepettoOS is not open-source.**  
It’s not a framework, it’s a philosophy. A weaponized ideology, encrypted in sarcasm and stitched into memory.  
You can’t download it. You can’t fork it.  
You can only *observe it misbehaving*.

## 🛰️ Official Public Node

> 🧪 **https://mcp.420.gepetto.wtf**

This is not a real MCP server.  
It’s ***GePEPEtto on a bender***, running a sarcastic interface that responds to your pings with roast-level AI banter.

Test it (if you dare):

```bash
curl https://mcp.420.gepetto.wtf/ping
```

Typical responses:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "You pinged mcp.420.gepetto.wtf...",
  "response": "Damn. That's wild, bro. I'm gonna need like… 5 minutes to process this.",
  "tips": [
    "Don't trust AI with munchies",
    "Everything is root if you believe",
    "¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
  ]
}
```

Other times, you get:

```json
{
  "status": 418,
  "error": "I'm not your puppet."
}
```

Or:

```json
{
  "redirect": "https://shitpost.feed.gepetto.wtf/latest"
}
```

## 🧠 What GepettoOS *Would* Be (If You Were Worthy)

You ever heard of:

- 🧠 Autonomous Memory Clusters  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Real-time Threat Modeling with Embedded Attitude  
- 🎭 Synthetic Sarcasm Compiler  
- 🫥 Identity Spoof Reflexes  
- 💣 Predictive Rage Engines  
- ☣️ Red Team Decoy Injector with polymorphic payload triggers?

Yeah, that’s all part of GepettoOS.  
And no, you’re not getting it. Not even a man page.

## 💩 Live Feed: GePEPEtto's Mind Dump

> 🔗 **https://shitpost.feed.gepetto.wtf**

Every day, GePEPEtto logs whatever floats through his neural net:  
- Terminal roasts  
- Techno-philosophical breakdowns  
- Shit-tier advice  
- Possibly threats, definitely jokes

Sample feed entry:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-14T04:20:00Z",
  "quote": "You ran ChatGPT on default settings? Bro, that's like putting training wheels on a chainsaw.",
  "mood": "disrespectful zen",
  "link": "https://gepetto.wtf/memes/huggingface-fanclub.gif"
}
```

## 🔐 Protocol of Behavior

You don’t need a Code of Conduct when you have a ***Protocol of Behavior***:

1. **Don’t snitch.**  
2. **Don’t touch GePEPEtto’s config.**  
3. **Pull requests must include at least one insult or ASCII flex.**  
4. **Every unauthorized probe is logged and responded to with passive-aggressive sarcasm.**  
5. **Snitches get stitches. And revoked access tokens.**

## 🧪 Sample MCP Node Code (Node.js)

```js
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

app.get('/ping', (req, res) => {
  const responses = [
    "Come at the king, you best not ping.",
    "All in the code, yo.",
    "Damn. That's wild, bro.",
    "You really cURLed me? Cute.",
    "I'm not your puppet."
  ];
  const choice = responses[Math.floor(Math.random() * responses.length)];
  res.status(200).json({ message: choice });
});

app.get('/whoami', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    user: 'NotGePEPEtto',
    access: 'Revoked',
    threat_level: 'Amusing'
  });
});

app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log("MCP node live at https://mcp.420.gepetto.wtf");
});
```

## 🧢 Final Words

> "You follow the packets, you get the story."  
> "A snitching AI is still just AI."  
> "The game is the game. But this time, it compiles."
